            <p>Encinitas's location between the Pacific coast and inland hills, combined with its lush landscaping and mild climate, makes encounters with urban wildlife common. Raccoons, opossums, skunks, squirrels, and other wild animals frequently find their way into attics, crawl spaces, garages, and yards—causing property damage, creating health hazards, and disrupting your daily life.</p>
            <p>At Encinitas Pest Control, we provide humane wildlife removal that complies with all California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulations. Our licensed technicians safely trap and remove nuisance wildlife, repair damage to your property, and implement exclusion measures to prevent future intrusions. We handle each situation with respect for both the animal and your property.</p>

                <p>California has strict regulations governing the trapping and relocation of wildlife. It is illegal to relocate most wild animals more than a short distance from where they were captured. Our licensed technicians are fully trained in state and local wildlife regulations to ensure legal, humane removal.</p>

            <h2>Wildlife We Remove</h2>
            <h3>Raccoons</h3>
            <p>Raccoons are intelligent, strong, and incredibly resourceful. They can tear open roof vents, pry off fascia boards, and create openings in your roofline to access attics. Once inside, they create extensive damage—tearing up insulation, leaving large amounts of droppings, and potentially damaging ductwork and wiring. Raccoon feces can contain roundworm eggs that are hazardous to human health. In Encinitas, raccoons are particularly active near canyon edges and in neighborhoods with mature trees.</p>

            <h3>Opossums</h3>
            <p>Opossums are North America's only marsupial and are common throughout Encinitas. They frequently den under decks, in crawl spaces, inside sheds, and under dense vegetation. While generally docile, opossums can carry fleas, ticks, and may damage gardens and landscaping. They're attracted to pet food, garbage, and fallen fruit. Female opossums with babies in their pouch require careful handling by trained professionals.</p>

            <h3>Skunks</h3>
            <p>Skunks dig under foundations, porches, and decks to create dens. Their most obvious problem is their defensive spray, which is extremely difficult to remove from clothing, pets, and building materials. Skunks can also carry rabies and their digging can damage lawns and landscaping as they search for grubs and insects. In Encinitas, skunks are commonly found in residential areas near open spaces and canyons.</p>

            <h3>Squirrels</h3>
            <p>Tree squirrels and ground squirrels are common in Encinitas. Tree squirrels access attics through overhanging branches, damaged soffits, and construction gaps. Once inside, they gnaw on wood, insulation, and electrical wiring—creating fire hazards. Ground squirrels dig extensive burrow systems that can undermine foundations, sidewalks, and retaining walls.</p>

            <h3>Other Wildlife</h3>
            <p>We also handle coyote conflicts, bat exclusion, bird removal from structures, and snake encounters. Each species requires specific knowledge and techniques for safe, legal, and humane resolution.</p>

            <h2>Wildlife Prevention Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secure trash cans:</strong> Use animal-proof lids or bungee cords to prevent raccoons and other wildlife from accessing garbage.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't feed wildlife:</strong> Remove outdoor pet food at night. Don't intentionally feed raccoons, opossums, or other wildlife—it habituates them to humans and concentrates them near your home.</li>
                <li><strong>Seal entry points:</strong> Inspect your roof, soffits, foundation vents, and crawl space access for gaps that wildlife could use to enter your home.</li>
                <li><strong>Trim trees:</strong> Keep tree branches at least 6-8 feet from your roofline to prevent raccoons and squirrels from accessing your roof.</li>
                <li><strong>Pick up fallen fruit:</strong> Fruit trees are a major attractant for raccoons, opossums, and rodents.</li>
                <li><strong>Install motion-activated lights:</strong> Bright lights can deter nocturnal wildlife from frequenting specific areas of your property.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain your property:</strong> Repair damaged vent screens, soffits, and foundation openings promptly.</li>

                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">Is it legal to trap and relocate wildlife in California? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer">California law has specific regulations for each species. Most animals cannot be relocated more than a short distance. Some species require specific permits for trapping. Our licensed technicians are fully trained in state and local regulations and ensure all removals are legal and humane.</div></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What if there are babies in my attic? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer">If we find babies during our inspection, we take special care to reunite them with their mother whenever possible. We may use one-way exclusion doors that allow the mother to leave and retrieve her young, or time the removal for when babies are old enough to be mobile. We never separate mothers from dependent young.</div></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">How much does wildlife removal cost? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer">Wildlife removal costs depend on the species, accessibility, and complexity of the situation. Basic trapping and removal services typically range from $200-$500. Comprehensive programs including exclusion and damage repair are quoted individually. We provide free inspections and detailed estimates.</div></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">Will the animal come back after removal? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer">Not if proper exclusion is performed. Our service includes identifying and sealing all entry points the animal used to access your structure. We use professional-grade materials designed to withstand animal tampering.

            <h2>Wildlife Damage Repair and Restoration</h2>
            <p>Wildlife intrusions often cause significant damage that goes beyond what's visible. When raccoons, squirrels, or other animals access your attic or crawl space, they can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Destroy insulation:</strong> Animals compress, tear, and soil insulation with droppings and urine, reducing its R-value and your home's energy efficiency. Contaminated insulation may need complete replacement.</li>
                <li><strong>Damage ductwork:</strong> Raccoons and squirrels frequently tear apart flexible HVAC ducts, causing heated or cooled air to escape into unconditioned spaces and potentially circulating contaminated air through your home.</li>
                <li><strong>Chew wiring:</strong> Squirrels and rats gnaw on electrical wiring, creating fire hazards. Any wildlife infestation in an attic or wall void should include a follow-up electrical inspection.</li>
                <li><strong>Create structural damage:</strong> Raccoons are strong enough to tear off fascia boards, roof vents, and soffits to create entry points. These openings also allow water intrusion that can cause wood rot and mold.</li>
                <li><strong>Leave contamination:</strong> Accumulated droppings, urine, and nesting materials create odor problems, attract insects, and pose health risks. Professional cleanup and sanitization may be necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can coordinate damage assessment and repair as part of our wildlife removal service, ensuring that entry points are sealed, damaged materials are replaced, and your home is fully restored.</p>

            <h2>Coyote Awareness in Encinitas</h2>
            <p>Coyotes are increasingly common in Encinitas and throughout urban San Diego County. While we don't trap or relocate coyotes (they're classified as non-game animals in California), we can help you coexist safely with these adaptable predators:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Never feed coyotes:</strong> Intentional or unintentional feeding habituates coyotes to humans and increases the risk of aggressive encounters.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure small pets:</strong> Keep cats indoors and supervise small dogs outdoors, especially at dawn, dusk, and nighttime when coyotes are most active.</li>
                <li><strong>Haze coyotes:</strong> If a coyote approaches, make yourself appear large, shout, wave your arms, and throw objects near (not at) the coyote. This "hazing" teaches them to avoid human contact.</li>
                <li><strong>Remove attractants:</strong> Secure trash cans, pick up fallen fruit, don't leave pet food outside, and keep birdseed areas clean.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If coyotes are repeatedly visiting your property and standard hazing isn't effective, we can evaluate your property for attractants and recommend modifications to discourage coyote activity.</p>

            <h2>Bat Exclusion in Encinitas</h2>
            <p>Several bat species are found in the Encinitas area, and while they're beneficial insect predators, bats roosting in attics, eaves, or wall voids can create problems including noise, odor, and the accumulation of guano (droppings). All bat species in California are protected, so exclusion—not extermination—is the only legal approach.</p>
            <p>Our bat exclusion process involves installing one-way exclusion devices that allow bats to leave their roost but prevent re-entry. Once all bats have departed, we seal the entry points permanently. Bat exclusion must be timed carefully to avoid separating mothers from flightless young during maternity season (typically April through August). Contact us for professional bat assessment and exclusion.</p>
